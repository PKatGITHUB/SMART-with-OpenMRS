# Arrest Assist

A tool that searches a patient's medical history via FHIR for reversible causes of PEA arrest.  Great for hospital based code teams who often know little about the patient when they arrive.  Specifically if searches for history of ESRD, pulmonary embolism, and heart attack.  It also pulls the last lab values for potassium, bicarb, pH, etc and orders with links to possible treatments.
